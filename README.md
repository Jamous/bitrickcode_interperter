Quote from Eli
--------------
When I was in preschool I wanted a language that stems from mores code so I came up with this and it still works just fine ðŸ™‚ almost like Linux but this little written language is almost 20 years old now and yet I did it before I even talked 
Also if you want the basics 

(: is at the end of a word :)

X = _

I = .
